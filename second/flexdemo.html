        <div class="flex3">A webinar is a form of one-to-many communication: a presenter can reach a large and specific group of online
            viewers from a single location. Providing it is used effectively, interaction during a webinar can be very
            powerful. Particularly when you have a large number of participants, smart tools are essential to channel that
            interaction.
